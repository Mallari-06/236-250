        <h2>Case – The Hidden Traps in Decision-Making</h2><hr style="border: solid black";>
        <p>(Excerpted from “The Hidden Traps in Decision Making “, by J .S. Hammond,R. L. Keeney and H. Raiffa, Harvard Business Review, September- October,1998, pp. 47 to 54)</p>
        <p><i>“In making decisions, your own mind may be your worst enemy.”</i></p>
        <p>What are the causes of a bad decision? Due to the complexity in structuring and formulating a decision-making problem and the high level of subjective judgment, bad decisions occur frequently. The “hidden traps” which accompany the decision-making process can cause errors in the formulation and structuring of a decision problem, as well as in choosing the correct alternative.</p><p>The main traps are:</p>
        <p>1. <b>“the anchoring trap”</b> – one of the most common types of an anchor (a weight that hangs from the ship in the same place) is a fixation on the “historical past” or “worldwide trend” or on “tradition”;</p>
        <p>2. <b>“the status-quo trap”</b> – the innovative alternatives tend to be similar to those that have been abandoned, or are just the same idea presented in a different way, i.e. there is an accommodation to remain in the same status;</p>
        <p>3. <b>“the sunk-cost trap”</b> – many decisions try to take losses (or gains) from the past into account, even though they are irrecoverable;</p>
        <p>4. <b>“the confirming-evidence trap”</b> – many decisions are based on evidences assumed in a polemical manner, such as “investing in television advertising is essential”, “we must invest in R&amp;D”, etc.;</p>
        <p>5. <b>“the framing trap”</b> – the same problem can be represented by a decision tree or table in a different way, depending on the point of view adopted; </p>
        <p>6. <b>“the estimating and forecasting trap”</b> – the effects of subjective or superficial judgments should be minimized in the estimation of values or demand forecasting;</p>
        <p>7. <b>“the overconfidence and prudence trap”</b> – excessive confidence or caution is not recommended in obtaining information or making decisions. </p>
        <p>One way to minimize the occurrence of “bad decisions” is to use the process of Sensibility Analysis, submitting a decision to controlled variations of the values involved. This analysis can be done if there is an opportunity to ask questions such as “WHAT IF?” at any given moment.</p>

        <p>1. Project:</p> <p>Make up several groups with five people at most in each. Use the Sunday classified ads from some national newspapers and construct the decision model (the decision matrix and the decision tree) for the following problems:</p>
        <p>(a) Select a residential property;<br>
(b) Select a piece of land to install a branch office of your company;<br>
(c) Choose a job;<br>
(d) Select a candidate for the position of manager;<br>
(e) Choose a new automobile;<br>
(f) Select a used car.<br></p>
        <p>Each problem should have at least five decision alternatives, i.e., choose five residential properties, five pieces of land, five cars, etc. The parameters and objectives or criteria for the decision should be defined by each group. Compare the decision matrixes constructed by different groups and discuss the causes for existing differences. </p>

            <h1>The Nature OfStrategic-Decision-Making Model</h1>
            <h2>Decision with Multiple Criteria and Multiple Scenarios</h2>
            
        </center><hr style="border: solid black";>
        
        <p>We will now study more complex problems considering:</p>
        <p><i>Multiple criteria or goals:</i></p>
        <p>• considering earnings or costs, delays, client satisfaction, etc, and</p>
        <p><i>Multiple scenarios:</i></p>
        <p>• where each scenario has a different risk level.</p>
        <p>In the multiple goal function problems, there is no optimum solution fully satisfying all goals at the same time. The individual goal’s functions are, in general, conflicting and it is not possible to have an optimization method to solve the problem. There is usually a consensus solution satisfying minimal criteria of optimum values for each individual goal function. This consensus is based on the Pareto’s principle presented in chapter nine. The optimal decision making in problems with multiple goals will be analyzed at the end of this chapter (Goicoechea et al., 1982; Keeney &amp; Raiffa, 1976; Dyson, 1990; Saaty, 1980, 1994; Bonabeau, 2003; Charan, 2001; Choo, 1998; Day et al., 1997).</p>
        
        <p>In considering restrictions across several scenarios, the problem solution becomes more difficult due to the high number of possible combinations of goal functions and scenarios to be considered.</p>
        <p>Using classical mathematical programming notation, the optimization problem with k goals and w scenarios could be formulated as follows:</p>
        <center>
            <p><i>Maximize (or Minimize) F (x) = (f1 (x) , f2 (x),..., fk (x))</i></p>
            <p><i>With restrictions:</i></p>
            <p><i>Scenario 1: g1j (x) < 0, (j=1,2,..., m1 ) and x Rn.;…</i></p>
            <p><i>Scenario w: gwj (x) < 0, (j=1,2,..., mw ) and x Rn.; </i></p>
        </center>
        <p>An efficient algorithm for this kind of problem has not yet been presented, unless using some kind of heuristic techniques. It should be noted that the mathematical programming problem formulated above does not consider the event of uncertainty or risk, which, in this case, would involve stochastic or probabilistic mathematical programming.</p>
        <p>Thus, the decision-making process is one of the methodologies indicated to resolve these problems, since it does not depend on complex mathematics involving scenario restrictions and multiple goals’ functions (Warfield, 1978,1994).</p>
        <p><i>Example 10.1.<br/>A strategic decision with multiple goals and different scenarios (Presented in Chapter VIII, as Example 8.3. Illustration of a political model of decision.)</i></p>
        <p>A company must choose one of the following strategies to develop a largeproject.</p>
        <p><i>Strategy or scenario A1:</i><br/>Develop the project entirely in the company, with:</p>
        <p>• 20% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $130 (million) and delay of 2 months,</p>
        <p>• 30% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $130 and delay of 3 months, or</p>
        <p>• 50% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $90 delay of 5 months</p>
        <p><i>Strategy or scenario A2:</i><br>Outsource the project and supervise it with:</p>
        <p>• 60% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $150 (million) without delay, or</p>
        <p>• 40% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $80 with a delay of 5 months.</p>
        <p><i>Strategy or scenario A3:</i><br/>Develop the project in partnership with a multinational company with:</p>
        <p>• 20% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $150 (million) without delay,</p>
        <p>40% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $130 with delay of 1 month, or</p>
        <p>• 40% chance of finishing the project at a cost of $120 with delay of 3 months.</p>
        <h2>Decision Tree<br><hr style="border: solid black";></h2>
        <p>By placing the problem on a decision tree we have </p>
        <center><img src="1.jpg"></center>
        <h2>Utility Values<br><hr style="border: solid black";></h2>
        <p>As shown before, the conversion of any kind of value (quantitative or non quantitative values) into utility values is made, first, by placing each goal value in order. Then, the value with highest preference is given the utility value of one and the value of lowest preference receives the utility value of zero. The utility values for the intermediate values are reached using the utility curve shown on Figure 10.1. The <i>risk neutral utility </i>curve shows the following results:</p>
        <h2>Joint Utility for the Two Goals: Delay and Cost<br><hr style="border: solid black";></h2>
        <p>Since there are two goals (or attributes x1 and x2) each value of the utility must be found by combining utilities u(x1) and u(x2) of these goals, using a method known as swing weight (Clemen and Reilly (2001)), given by the formula u (x1, x2) = k1 . u (x1) + k2 . u (x2), where k1 and k2 are weights satisfying the equality k1+k2=1.</p>
        <p>In this method, it is presumed that the utility of the Delay u(x1) is independent from the utility of Cost u(x2) and vice-versa, and that there is no interaction between the two goals in determining the utility value. It can then be said that goals x1 and x2 are mutually independent in regard to utility. If we establish a preference saying that Cost is more important than Delay and that Delay has 70% of the importance of Cost, we would have k1 = 0.7 x k2. Since k1 + k2 = 1, we have k1 = 0.7 x (1- k1), and then k1 = 0.4 and k2 =0.6.</p>
        <p>These weights address the following conditions:</p>
        <center>
            <p>u(worst delay, worst cost) = u(5 months , $150) = 0.4 0 + 0.6 0 = 0<br/>
u(worst delay, best cost) = u(5 moths , $80) = 0.4 0 + 0.6 1 = 0.6<br/>
u(best delay, worst cost) = u (0 months , $150) = 0.4 1 + 0.6 0 = 0.4<br/>
u(best delay, best cost) = u (0 months , $80) = 0.4 1 + 0.6 1 = 1.0.<br/></p>
        </center>
        <p><i>Figure 10.1. Utility curve for Example 10.1</i></p>
        <center><img src="2.jpg"></center>
        <p>By replacing costs and delays values by their respective utility values, and reaching the joint utility values u (x1, x2), we have a new decision tree:</p>
        <center><img src="3.jpg"></center>
        <p>The Expected Utility Values are:</p>
        <p>EUV1 = 0.2 0.42 + 0.3 0.34 + 0.5 x 0.54 = 0.456,<br/>
EUV2 = 0.6 0.4 + 0.4 0.60 = 0.48, and<br/>
EUV3 = 0.2 0.4 + 0.4 0.5 + 0.4 0.4 = 0.44.<br/></p>
        <p>Thus, the company that prefers to be risk neutral will prefer strategy A2.</p>
        <p>If the company prefers to choose the utility curve with “risk aversion” we may have the following values: EUV1 = 0.541, EUV2 = 0.48 e EUV3 = 0.608, and the best decision for the company with risk aversion is A3, where costs are not the best but there are better delivery possibilities. Using the curve expressing <i>risk preference or risk taker</i>, in Figure 10.1, the company may choose alternative A1.</p>
        <h2>Sensitivity Analysis and “What If?” Question<br><hr style="border: solid black";></h2>
        
        <p>In example 10.1:</p>
        <p>a. the company, preferring to be risk neutral, should choose strategy A2;</p>
        <p>b. risk averting company would choose strategy A3, where costs are not the best but there are better delivery possibilities; and</p>
        <p>c. the risk preferring company may choose alternative A1.</p>
        <p>In any decision problem, one should not consider a decision based only on a scenario with fixed values of the parameters involved, since several subjective assessments were used for structuring the decision problem. The decision maker tries to make a decision based on the “best information available” out of the several possible variations involved. Which are these variation alternatives?</p>
        <p>Adecision support system should provide the possibility of answering<i>“What– if”</i>questions, that is, the chance to answer the question</p>
        <p><i>“WHAT WOULD HAPPEN to the strategy IF the earnings values, the schedule or the probabilities were different?”</i></p>
        <p>Considering that strategy A1 — Developing the project inside the company — was the best decision only in the case of risk taker or preference, the company could make the following question.</p>
        <p><i>“What – if?<br/>What to do, or in which conditions is strategy A1 the best solution in a risk neutral case?”</i></p>
        <p>Since the example 10.1 is a complex decision case, involving different values of delays and costs for each scenario, the analysis of the best strategy for each possible combination of the variations of values demands hard work and is not always recommended, since it involves several cases with no practical interest. The sensitivity analysis chart used in the previous example, varying probabilities p1 and p2, and leaving the third probability p3= 1 – p1 – p2 implicit, is also not useful, for the same reasons.</p>
        <p>The sensibility analysis should then be limited to the variations of parameters (probabilities, costs, or delays) of strategy A1, where the company can alter these values. The two other strategies, including the involvement of othercompanies and the change in the values of these scenarios, depend on negotiations with them. Even in strategy A1, only one of the three variables should be examined at a time (probability, delay, or cost), leaving the others as they are, to avoid the explosive increase in the number of possible cases.</p>
    
        <p><i>Sensitivity analysis a:</i> </p>
        <p>Analysis of other probabilities values of strategy A1, leaving the values for Delay and Cost unchanged.</p>
        <center><img src="4.jpg"> </center>
        <P>The best strategy is now A1 because its EUV or average value is greater than those of other scenarios.</P>
        <p><i>Sensitivity analysis b:</i></p>
        <p>Changing the values of Costs in Strategy A1, leaving unchanged the values of probabilities and delay.</p>
        <p>Altering costs for $120, $120 and $90 with utilities 0.4, 0.4 and 0.9, respectively we have:</p>
        <center><img src="5.jpg"></center>
        <p><i>Sensitivity analysis c:</i></p>
        <p>Changing the values for Delay on strategy A1, leaving unchanged the values for Probabilities and Cost.</p>
        <p>The delays now are of 1, 3 and 4 months, with new utility values.</p>
        <center><img src="6.jpg"></center>.
        <p>The best strategy again, is A1.</p>
        <center><h2>Optimal Decisions<hr style="border: solid black";></h2></center>
        <p>In the previous chapters, it was stated that a decision problem cannot be solved just by scientific models and that, in order to define a decision-making model, it is necessary to adopt the <i>“satisfactory model”</i> based on “bounded rationality ” such as the “near conflict resolution” or “minimizing uncertainty”</p>
        <p>Further, it was stressed that the search for a solution should neither be random nor exhaustive. The search for a solution within the organization should be focused on the main problem goals and the possible alternative solutions should be looked for in the vicinity of these goals.</p>
        <p>However, it is often interesting, or even necessary, to represent and analyze a decision problem from the standpoint of its optimum or optimized solution. In an optimization scenario, criteria or goals may be considered as objectives to be optimized or as part of restricting conditions. In the formulation of Nonlinear Mathematical Programming models, every goal or criterion except one can be described as a restriction, in order to maintain the mathematical formulation of the optimization problem with a single objective (Hillier &amp; Liebermann, 1980; Shamblin &amp; Stevens, 1980).</p>
        <p>In Linear Programming (LP) both a single function goal z and the m restriction equations should be <i>linear</i>, in order to enable the applications of the method known as SIMPLEX, on a convex region of feasible solutions. If any of theseequations is <i>nonlinear</i>, the optimization problem should be solved using theNonlinear Programming or Dynamic Programming methods, whose resolution is usually very difficult.</p>
        <h2>Optimal Multiple Criteria (or Multi-Objective)Decision-Making in Industry</h2>
        <p>In problems with multiple goals it is not possible to establish an optimum solution satisfying every goal or objective. Solutions that address all criteria or goals, called “ideal solutions” usually cannot be found among the feasiblesolutions of the original problem. The individual goals are usually conflicting, and it is necessary to find a compromise solution based on Pareto’s principle. The pre-established restrictions of the available resources may not enable the search for an “ideal solution” outside the region of feasible solutions. That means that, the ideal solution is unfeasible, as shown in Figure 10.2.</p>
        <p>a. In the case where existing restrictions or resources are not limited, the restrictions may be extended or “relaxed” until they encompass the ideal solution restrictions. That is what happens with the formulation called “De Novo” programming reported in Tabucanon (1988).</p>
